Simple bootstrap/template put together to start project
Used as reference the tutorial on how to create a React frontend and a Node/Express backend and connect them

Prepared this to myself and my brother (and best friend) who sujested I could share on github.

Not rocket science, just tided up to the way I'm learning to start my projects.

Feel free to use and modify!

Instructions to start up:

API
In the terminal go to api folder, command "cd api" from myBootStrap folder then execute the command "npm start"

Client
Same idea, in the terminal go to client folder and execute the command "yarn start"


Happy coding!
